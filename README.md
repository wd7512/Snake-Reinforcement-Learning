# Snake-Reinforcement-Learning

### Overview
My longest ongoing project, building a reinforcement learning algorithm to have very general use. Interestingly one can see how my code has evolved over the years. I have posted an article on attempt 5 which was successful at playing the game of snake. In the future I hope to develop my own package so I can easily implement my own algorithms to projects.
